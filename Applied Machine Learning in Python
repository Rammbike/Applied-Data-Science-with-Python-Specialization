Assignment 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
For this assignment, you will be using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database to create a classifier that can help diagnose patients. First, read through the description of the dataset (below).

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
​
cancer = load_breast_cancer()
​
#print(cancer.DESCR) # Print the data set description
The object returned by load_breast_cancer() is a scikit-learn Bunch object, which is similar to a dictionary.

cancer.keys()
dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])
Question 0 (Example)
How many features does the breast cancer dataset have?

This function should return an integer.

# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the number of features of the breast cancer dataset, which is an integer. 
    # The assignment question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return len(cancer['feature_names'])
​
# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero()

Question 1
Scikit-learn works with lists, numpy arrays, scipy-sparse matrices, and pandas DataFrames, so converting the dataset to a DataFrame is not necessary for training this model. Using a DataFrame does however help make many things easier such as munging data, so let's practice creating a classifier with a pandas DataFrame.

Convert the sklearn.dataset cancer to a DataFrame.

This function should return a (569, 31) DataFrame with

columns =

['mean radius', 'mean texture', 'mean perimeter', 'mean area',
'mean smoothness', 'mean compactness', 'mean concavity',
'mean concave points', 'mean symmetry', 'mean fractal dimension',
'radius error', 'texture error', 'perimeter error', 'area error',
'smoothness error', 'compactness error', 'concavity error',
'concave points error', 'symmetry error', 'fractal dimension error',
'worst radius', 'worst texture', 'worst perimeter', 'worst area',
'worst smoothness', 'worst compactness', 'worst concavity',
'worst concave points', 'worst symmetry', 'worst fractal dimension',
'target']
and index =

RangeIndex(start=0, stop=569, step=1)
def answer_one():
    df = pd.DataFrame(cancer.data, columns=cancer.feature_names)
    df['target'] = pd.Series(cancer.target)
    return df
Question 2
What is the class distribution? (i.e. how many instances of malignant (encoded 0) and how many benign (encoded 1)?)

This function should return a Series named target of length 2 with integer values and index = ['malignant', 'benign']

def answer_two():
    cancerdf = answer_one()
    label = {0: 'malignant', 1: 'benign'}
    cancerdf['target'] = cancerdf['target'].map(label)
    return cancerdf['target'].value_counts()
benign       357
malignant    212
Name: target, dtype: int64
Question 3
Split the DataFrame into X (the data) and y (the labels).

This function should return a tuple of length 2: (X, y), where

X, a pandas DataFrame, has shape (569, 30)
y, a pandas Series, has shape (569,).
def answer_three():
    cancerdf = answer_one()
    X = cancerdf.iloc[:, :30]
    y = cancerdf.iloc[:, -1]
    
    return X, y
​
Question 4
Using train_test_split, split X and y into training and test sets (X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test).

Set the random number generator state to 0 using random_state=0 to make sure your results match the autograder!

This function should return a tuple of length 4: (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test), where

X_train has shape (426, 30)
X_test has shape (143, 30)
y_train has shape (426,)
y_test has shape (143,)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
​
def answer_four():
    X, y = answer_three()
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
    
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
Question 5
Using KNeighborsClassifier, fit a k-nearest neighbors (knn) classifier with X_train, y_train and using one nearest neighbor (n_neighbors = 1).

This function should return a sklearn.neighbors.classification.KNeighborsClassifier.

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
​
def answer_five():
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = answer_four()
    return KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 1).fit(X_train, y_train)
Question 6
Using your knn classifier, predict the class label using the mean value for each feature.

Hint: You can use cancerdf.mean()[:-1].values.reshape(1, -1) which gets the mean value for each feature, ignores the target column, and reshapes the data from 1 dimension to 2 (necessary for the precict method of KNeighborsClassifier).

This function should return a numpy array either array([ 0.]) or array([ 1.])

def answer_six():
    cancerdf = answer_one()
    knn = answer_five()
    means = cancerdf.mean()[:-1].values.reshape(1, -1)
    return [knn.predict(mean) for mean in means]
/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/utils/validation.py:395: DeprecationWarning: Passing 1d arrays as data is deprecated in 0.17 and will raise ValueError in 0.19. Reshape your data either using X.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or X.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
  DeprecationWarning)
[array([1])]
Question 7
Using your knn classifier, predict the class labels for the test set X_test.

This function should return a numpy array with shape (143,) and values either 0.0 or 1.0.

def answer_seven():
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = answer_four()
    knn = answer_five()
    knn.predict(X_test)
    return knn.predict(X_test)
Question 8
Find the score (mean accuracy) of your knn classifier using X_test and y_test.

This function should return a float between 0 and 1

def answer_eight():
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = answer_four()
    knn = answer_five()
    return knn.score(X_test, y_test)
Optional plot
Try using the plotting function below to visualize the differet predicition scores between training and test sets, as well as malignant and benign cells.

def accuracy_plot():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
​
    %matplotlib notebook

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = answer_four()
​
    # Find the training and testing accuracies by target value (i.e. malignant, benign)
    mal_train_X = X_train[y_train==0]
    mal_train_y = y_train[y_train==0]

    # Plot the scores as a bar chart
    bars = plt.bar(np.arange(4), scores, color=['#4c72b0','#4c72b0','#55a868','#55a868'])
​
    # directly label the score onto the bars
    for bar in bars:
        height = bar.get_height()
        plt.gca().text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, height*.90, '{0:.{1}f}'.format(height, 2),

Assignment 2
In this assignment you'll explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models. Part 1 of this assignment will look at regression and Part 2 will look at classification.

Part 1 - Regression
First, run the following block to set up the variables needed for later sections.

import numpy as np

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
​
​
np.random.seed(0)
n = 15
x = np.linspace(0,10,n) + np.random.randn(n)/5
y = np.sin(x)+x/6 + np.random.randn(n)/10
​
​
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, random_state=0)
​
# You can use this function to help you visualize the dataset by
# plotting a scatterplot of the data points
# in the training and test sets.
def part1_scatter():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib notebook
    plt.figure()

         7.17166586,   4.96972856,   8.14799756,   2.59103578,
         0.35281047,   3.375973  ,   8.72363612])
Question 1
Write a function that fits a polynomial LinearRegression model on the training data X_train for degrees 1, 3, 6, and 9. (Use PolynomialFeatures in sklearn.preprocessing to create the polynomial features and then fit a linear regression model) For each model, find 100 predicted values over the interval x = 0 to 10 (e.g. np.linspace(0,10,100)) and store this in a numpy array. The first row of this array should correspond to the output from the model trained on degree 1, the second row degree 3, the third row degree 6, and the fourth row degree 9.



The figure above shows the fitted models plotted on top of the original data (using plot_one()).


This function should return a numpy array with shape (4, 100)

def answer_one():
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
    final = np.zeros((4, 100))

        linreg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train_poly, y_train)
        results = linreg.predict(poly.fit_transform(np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(100, 1)))
        final[i, :] = results
    return final

Question 2
Write a function that fits a polynomial LinearRegression model on the training data X_train for degrees 0 through 9. For each model compute the R2R2 (coefficient of determination) regression score on the training data as well as the the test data, and return both of these arrays in a tuple.

This function should return one tuple of numpy arrays (r2_train, r2_test). Both arrays should have shape (10,)

def answer_two():
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
    from sklearn.metrics.regression import r2_score
​
    r2_train = np.zeros(10)
    r2_test = np.zeros(10)
​
    for i, degree in enumerate(range(10)):
        poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree = degree)
        
        
        X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train.reshape(-1, 1))
        linreg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train_poly, y_train)
        r2_train[i] = linreg.score(X_train_poly, y_train)
​
        
        X_test_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_test.reshape(-1, 1))
        r2_test[i] = linreg.score(X_test_poly, y_test)
​
    return (r2_train, r2_test)
​
    
Question 3
Based on the R2R2 scores from question 2 (degree levels 0 through 9), what degree level corresponds to a model that is underfitting? What degree level corresponds to a model that is overfitting? What choice of degree level would provide a model with good generalization performance on this dataset?

Hint: Try plotting the R2R2 scores from question 2 to visualize the relationship between degree level and R2R2. Remember to comment out the import matplotlib line before submission.

This function should return one tuple with the degree values in this order: (Underfitting, Overfitting, Good_Generalization). There might be multiple correct solutions, however, you only need to return one possible solution, for example, (1,2,3).

r2_scores = answer_two()
    df = pd.DataFrame({'training_score':r2_scores[0], 'test_score':r2_scores[1]})
    df['diff'] = df['training_score'] - df['test_score']

    Good_Generalization  = df['diff'].idxmin()
    Overfitting = df['training_score'].idxmax()
    Underfitting = df['training_score'].idxmin()
def answer_three():
    
    r2_scores = answer_two()
    df = pd.DataFrame({'training_score':r2_scores[0], 'test_score':r2_scores[1]})

​
    Good_Generalization  = df['diff'].idxmin()
    Overfitting = df['training_score'].idxmax()
    Underfitting = df['training_score'].idxmin()
    
    return (Underfitting, Overfitting, Good_Generalization)
df
r2_scores = answer_two()
df = pd.DataFrame({'training_score':r2_scores[0], 'test_score':r2_scores[1]})
df['diff'] = df['training_score'] - df['test_score']
​
Good_Generalization  = df['diff'].idxmin()
Overfitting = df['training_score'].idxmax()
Underfitting = df['training_score'].idxmin()
df
test_score	training_score	diff
0	-0.478086	0.000000	0.478086
1	-0.452371	0.429246	0.881617
2	-0.068570	0.451100	0.519670
3	0.005331	0.587200	0.581868

6	0.921409	0.990182	0.068773
7	0.920215	0.993525	0.073310
8	0.632480	0.996375	0.363896
9	-0.645254	0.998037	1.643291
Question 4
Training models on high degree polynomial features can result in overly complex models that overfit, so we often use regularized versions of the model to constrain model complexity, as we saw with Ridge and Lasso linear regression.

For this question, train two models: a non-regularized LinearRegression model (default parameters) and a regularized Lasso Regression model (with parameters alpha=0.01, max_iter=10000) both on polynomial features of degree 12. Return the R2R2 score for both the LinearRegression and Lasso model's test sets.

This function should return one tuple (LinearRegression_R2_test_score, Lasso_R2_test_score)

def answer_four():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
    from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics.regression import r2_score
​
    poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=12)
    X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train.reshape(-1, 1))
    X_test_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_test.reshape(-1, 1))
​
    linreg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train_poly, y_train)
    LinearRegression_R2_test_score = linreg.score(X_test_poly, y_test)
​
    lassoreg = Lasso(alpha=0.01, max_iter=10000).fit(X_train_poly, y_train)
    Lasso_R2_test_score = lassoreg.score(X_test_poly, y_test)
​
    return (LinearRegression_R2_test_score, Lasso_R2_test_score)
​
Part 2 - Classification
Here's an application of machine learning that could save your life! For this section of the assignment we will be working with the UCI Mushroom Data Set stored in readonly/mushrooms.csv. The data will be used to train a model to predict whether or not a mushroom is poisonous. The following attributes are provided:

The data in the mushrooms dataset is currently encoded with strings. These values will need to be encoded to numeric to work with sklearn. We'll use pd.get_dummies to convert the categorical variables into indicator variables.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
​
​
mush_df = pd.read_csv('mushrooms.csv')
mush_df2 = pd.get_dummies(mush_df)
​
X_mush = mush_df2.iloc[:,2:]
y_mush = mush_df2.iloc[:,1]
​
# use the variables X_train2, y_train2 for Question 5
X_train2, X_test2, y_train2, y_test2 = train_test_split(X_mush, y_mush, random_state=0)
​
# For performance reasons in Questions 6 and 7, we will create a smaller version of the
# entire mushroom dataset for use in those questions.  For simplicity we'll just re-use
# the 25% test split created above as the representative subset.
#
# Use the variables X_subset, y_subset for Questions 6 and 7.
X_subset = X_test2
y_subset = y_test2
Question 5
Using X_train2 and y_train2 from the preceeding cell, train a DecisionTreeClassifier with default parameters and random_state=0. What are the 5 most important features found by the decision tree?

As a reminder, the feature names are available in the X_train2.columns property, and the order of the features in X_train2.columns matches the order of the feature importance values in the classifier's feature_importances_ property.

This function should return a list of length 5 containing the feature names in descending order of importance.

Note: remember that you also need to set random_state in the DecisionTreeClassifier.

def answer_five():
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
​
    importance = []
​
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 0)
    clf = clf.fit(X_train2, y_train2)
    result = dict(zip( X_train2.columns, clf.feature_importances_))
    for v, k in sorted(result.items(), key = lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
        importance.append(v)
    
​
    return importance[:5]

Question 6
For this question, we're going to use the validation_curve function in sklearn.model_selection to determine training and test scores for a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with varying parameter values. Recall that the validation_curve function, in addition to taking an initialized unfitted classifier object, takes a dataset as input and does its own internal train-test splits to compute results.

Because creating a validation curve requires fitting multiple models, for performance reasons this question will use just a subset of the original mushroom dataset: please use the variables X_subset and y_subset as input to the validation curve function (instead of X_mush and y_mush) to reduce computation time.

The initialized unfitted classifier object we'll be using is a Support Vector Classifier with radial basis kernel. So your first step is to create an SVC object with default parameters (i.e. kernel='rbf', C=1) and random_state=0. Recall that the kernel width of the RBF kernel is controlled using the gamma parameter.

With this classifier, and the dataset in X_subset, y_subset, explore the effect of gamma on classifier accuracy by using the validation_curve function to find the training and test scores for 6 values of gamma from 0.0001 to 10 (i.e. np.logspace(-4,1,6)). Recall that you can specify what scoring metric you want validation_curve to use by setting the "scoring" parameter. In this case, we want to use "accuracy" as the scoring metric.

For each level of gamma, validation_curve will fit 3 models on different subsets of the data, returning two 6x3 (6 levels of gamma x 3 fits per level) arrays of the scores for the training and test sets.

Find the mean score across the three models for each level of gamma for both arrays, creating two arrays of length 6, and return a tuple with the two arrays.

e.g.

if one of your array of scores is

array([[ 0.5,  0.4,  0.6],
       [ 0.7,  0.8,  0.7],
       [ 0.9,  0.8,  0.8],
       [ 0.8,  0.7,  0.8],
       [ 0.7,  0.6,  0.6],
       [ 0.4,  0.6,  0.5]])
it should then become

array([ 0.5,  0.73333333,  0.83333333,  0.76666667,  0.63333333, 0.5])
This function should return one tuple of numpy arrays (training_scores, test_scores) where each array in the tuple has shape (6,).

train_scores, test_scores
def answer_six():
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve
​
    clf = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1, random_state = 0).fit(X_subset, y_subset)
    gamma = np.logspace(-4,1,6)
    train_scores, test_scores = validation_curve(SVC(), X_subset, y_subset, param_name = 'gamma', param_range = gamma, cv = 3)
​
    return (train_scores.mean(axis=1), test_scores.mean(axis=1))
train_scores
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve
clf = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1, random_state = 0).fit(X_subset, y_subset)
gamma = np.logspace(-4,1,6)
train_scores, test_scores = validation_curve(SVC(), X_subset, y_subset, param_name = 'gamma', param_range = gamma, cv = 3)
a = train_scores.mean(axis=1)
b = test_scores.mean(axis=1)
​
Question 7
Based on the scores from question 6, what gamma value corresponds to a model that is underfitting (and has the worst test set accuracy)? What gamma value corresponds to a model that is overfitting (and has the worst test set accuracy)? What choice of gamma would be the best choice for a model with good generalization performance on this dataset (high accuracy on both training and test set)?

Hint: Try plotting the scores from question 6 to visualize the relationship between gamma and accuracy. Remember to comment out the import matplotlib line before submission.

This function should return one tuple with the degree values in this order: (Underfitting, Overfitting, Good_Generalization) Please note there is only one correct solution.

def answer_seven():
    train_scores, test_scores = answer_six()
    gamma = np.logspace(-4,1,6)
    df = pd.DataFrame(train_scores, test_scores).reset_index()
    df.columns = ['train', 'test']
    df.set_index(gamma, inplace=True)
    df['diff'] = abs(df['train'] - df['test'])
​
    under = df
    under = under[under['train'] < under['test']]
    underfitting = under['test'].argmin()
    overfitting = df['diff'].argmax()
    good = df['diff'].argmin()
    
    return (underfitting, overfitting, good)
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Assignment 3 - Evaluation
In this assignment you will train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud using data based on this dataset from Kaggle.

Each row in fraud_data.csv corresponds to a credit card transaction. Features include confidential variables V1 through V28 as well as Amount which is the amount of the transaction.

The target is stored in the class column, where a value of 1 corresponds to an instance of fraud and 0 corresponds to an instance of not fraud.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
Question 1
Import the data from fraud_data.csv. What percentage of the observations in the dataset are instances of fraud?

This function should return a float between 0 and 1.

def answer_one():

​
    clf = SVC().fit(X_train, y_train)
    prediction = clf.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)

This function should return a confusion matrix, a 2x2 numpy array with 4 integers.

def answer_four():
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
​
    clf = SVC(C=1e9, gamma=1e-07).fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_score = clf.decision_function(X_test) > -220 
    confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_score)
​
    return confusion
Question 5
Train a logisitic regression classifier with default parameters using X_train and y_train.

For the logisitic regression classifier, create a precision recall curve and a roc curve using y_test and the probability estimates for X_test (probability it is fraud).

Looking at the precision recall curve, what is the recall when the precision is 0.75?

Looking at the roc curve, what is the true positive rate when the false positive rate is 0.16?

This function should return a tuple with two floats, i.e. (recall, true positive rate).

def answer_five():
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, roc_curve
    #import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    #%matplotlib notebook
​
    clf = LogisticRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_scores_lr = clf.decision_function(X_test)
    precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_scores_lr)

Question 6
Perform a grid search over the parameters listed below for a Logisitic Regression classifier, using recall for scoring and the default 3-fold cross validation.

'penalty': ['l1', 'l2']

'C':[0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]

From .cv_results_, create an array of the mean test scores of each parameter combination. i.e.

l1	l2
0.01	?	?
0.1	?	?
1	?	?
10	?	?
100	?	?


This function should return a 5 by 2 numpy array with 10 floats.

Note: do not return a DataFrame, just the values denoted by '?' above in a numpy array. You might need to reshape your raw result to meet the format we are looking for.

grid_clf_acc = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid = grid_values)

    grid_clf_acc = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid = grid_values, scoring='recall')
    grid_clf_acc.fit(X_train, y_train) 
    results = grid_clf_acc.cv_results_
    result = results['mean_test_score']
    test_scores = np.vstack((results['split0_test_score'], results['split1_test_score'], results['split2_test_score']))
    return test_scores.mean(axis=0).reshape(5, 2)
